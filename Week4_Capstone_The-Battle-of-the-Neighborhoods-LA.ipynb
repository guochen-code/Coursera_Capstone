    "This is a capstone project for **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate**. In this project we will try to find an optimal neighborhood for a restaurant in the city of Los Angeles, United States. Specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening an restaurant in Los Angeles.\n",

    "Since there are lots of neighborhoods in Los Angeles we will try to detect **neighborhood candidates that are not already crowded with restaurants and have favorable charateristics to support new restaurants**. We are also particularly interested in **neighborhoods with larger population base and higher household income**. We would also prefer locations **with lower business cost and crime rate**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use our data science powers to generate a few most promissing neighborhoods based on this criteria. Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final neighborhood can be chosen by stakeholders."
